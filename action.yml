      Used to pull atmos distributions from Cloud Posse's GitHub repository. Since there's a default, this is typically
      not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on
      GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
