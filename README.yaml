# Short description of this project
description: Install atmos for use in GitHub Actions

introduction: |-
  This repo contains a GitHub Action to setup [atmos](https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos) for use in GitHub Actions. It 
  installs the specified version of atmos and adds it to the `PATH` so it can be used in subsequent steps. In addition, 
  it optionally installs a wrapper script that will capture the `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitcode` of the `atmos` 
  command and make them available to subsequent steps via outputs of the same name.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
    
    - name: Setup atmos
      uses: cloudposse/setup-atmos@v1
  ````

  To install a specific version of atmos, set the `version` input:

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2

    - name: Setup atmos
      uses: cloudposse/setup-atmos@v1
      with:
        version: 0.15.0
  ````

  The wrapper script installation can be skipped by setting the `install-wrapper` input to `false`:

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2

    - name: Setup atmos
      uses: cloudposse/setup-atmos@v1
      with:
        install-wrapper: false
  ````

  Subsequent steps of the GitHub action can use the wrapper scipt to capture the `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitcode` if 
  the wrapper script was installed:

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2

    - name: Setup atmos
      uses: cloudposse/setup-atmos@v1
      with:
        install-wrapper: true

    - name: Run atmos
      id: atmos
      run: atmos terraform plan

    - run: echo ${{ steps.atmos.outputs.stdout }}
    - run: echo ${{ steps.atmos.outputs.stderr }}
    - run: echo ${{ steps.atmos.outputs.exitcode }}
  ```
